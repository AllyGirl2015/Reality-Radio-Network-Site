Our Story
Our story is but a humble begining. For starters, we aren't like everyone else. We want to transition away from AI generated products. We have seen how many are trasitioning towards AI replacing the people. Our model is the inverse of that. We want to use AI as our foundation, and later grow beyond the depths, Hire real people, and make real music.

Our founder, known as Alissa M.R. Eldridge, wants nothing more than to remove AI from the immediate production line, and to bring talented people from the bottom of the unknown, and help them rise to the highest parts of fame. But the journey doesn't stop there. Music is only the start, from music, and CDs, and a Persona Adoption program, to book publishing, philosophy, and theoretical frameworks, to Film and Animation, Video Games, and Technologies. We seek to do it all for the sake of raising everyone up.

Every penny that can be will be invested back into the business and infrastructure to grow it even further. RRN is only the start, and that is exactly what it was meant to be, a doorway into a vast array of possitive change and growth.

With that? We leave you with only one question, are you going to be a pillar for it's growth, or a phantom passing through?
