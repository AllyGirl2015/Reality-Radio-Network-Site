Welcome to the Reality Radio Network Store!
We’re so excited to have you here.

Our lineup may be small for now, but we’ve got some heartfelt stories to share. From Johnathan Gold to Kaira Heartfelt, our country-inspired personas are ready to make their way into the world — and into your speakers.

Before you dive in, we want to share a few important notes:

We’re proudly indie.
Reality Radio Network is still a small, independent label. That means we’re doing this with love and care — but also with limited resources. Mistakes will happen, and we appreciate your patience as we grow and improve.


Handmade takes time.
Every physical product you order is made by hand. Each disc, label, and package takes real time and effort from a real person. Please allow us the space to create something worth receiving.


AI is our starting point — not the destination.
In keeping with RBEW’s transparency policy, we want you to know our current artist roster is AI-generated. But this is only the beginning. Our vision is to find real people to fully adopt these personas — name, style, and likeness — as a long-term, collaborative creative project.
Anyone who steps into these roles will help shape their persona’s music, story, and direction. When you buy from us now, you’re helping build that future.


Finally, we want to set clear expectations for shipping:
Our current maximum wait time for product fulfillment is 2 weeks. That’s our best-case timeline right now, and we’re committed to keeping you updated if that ever changes.

Thank you for being here, for supporting our work, and for helping us make this vision a reality.
